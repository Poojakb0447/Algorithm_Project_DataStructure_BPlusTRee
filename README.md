# Algorithm_Project_DataStructure_BPlusTRee

This project consists of two parts: a B+ tree for storing parts data and a user interface for accessing the data. 
Today a parts catalog would be built using a database for storage. 
Databases are very versatile in their ability to store and retrieve data. 
In this project, you will build a parts catalog system as a single-user system without the use of a database. 
Instead, you will create a B+-tree and store the parts data in it.
